# RUSTikales Rust for beginners
## Overview
This subdirectory contains resources for my Rust course aimed towards beginners.  
Each session is made out of those parts:
- original.pptx - Original PowerPoint presentation
- slides.pdf - Presentation exported as PDF
- exercises.md - Exercises for that session
- solutions.md - Solutions for that session's exercises
- Optionally: Some example projects to showcase something
  - For example, a small project to showcase loops, or the Borrow Checker
## Usage
`git clone` to get a local copy of this repository. Then regularly `git pull` to get the updated slides.  
Alternatively, you can browse it on Github, which also supports PDF and Markdown rendering.  
Exercises are meant to be self-checks, possible solutions are given in the corresponding file.
