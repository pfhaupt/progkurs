# Loops
## Usage
To get started, you'll need a working Rust environment. Open up your go-to editor and follow the instructions in each exercise. The difficulty ratings are there to give you an idea of what to expect, based on what you've learned.

## Goal
The goal of these exercises is to familiarize you with Rust's arrays and vectors. You'll learn to work with indices, manipulate your first data structures, and gain a basic understanding of how arrays and vectors are used in Rust.

The goal of these exercises is to familiarize you with Rust's ways of looping. You'll learn to work with loops, iterate over your first data structures, and gain a basic understanding of how loops are used in Rust.


## Exercise 1: Basic Loop
```
Rating: 1/3 (Yellow)
Task:
1. Use a basic `loop` to print "Rust is fun!" five times.
```

## Exercise 2: While Loop with Counter
```
Rating: 1/3 (Yellow)
Task:
1. Use a `while` loop and a counter to print the numbers 1 to 5.
```

## Exercise 3: For Loop Over a Range
```
Rating: 1/3 (Yellow)
Task:
1. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the range 1..=10 and print each number.
Hint:
a. Number ranges:
> x..y is a range that starts at x and stops at y (exclusive)
> x..=y is a range that starts at x and stops at y (inclusive)
```

## Exercise 4: Loop with Break
```
Rating: 1/3 (Yellow)
Task:
1. Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 upwards.
2. Use `break` to exit the loop when it reaches 10.
```

## Exercise 5: Nested Loops
```
Rating: 2/3 (Red)
Task:
1. Create nested loops where the outer loop runs 3 times and the inner loop runs 5 times.
2. Print the iteration count of both loops in each cycle.
```
## Exercise 6: Summation with a For Loop
```
Rating: 1/3 (Yellow)
Task:
1. Use a `for` loop to sum the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
2. Print the final sum.
```

## Exercise 7: Reversing an Array with a Loop
```
Rating: 2/3 (Red)
Task:
1. Create an array with five elements.
2. Use a loop to reverse the array and print it.
```

## Exercise 8: Finding a Number with While Loop
```
Rating: 2/3 (Red)
Task:
1. Create an array of integers.
2. Use a `while` loop to find and print the position of the number 15 in the array. If your array does not contain 15, print the sum of all elements instead.
```

## Exercise 9: Loop Control with Continue
```
Rating: 3/3 (Purple)
Task:
1. Write a `for` loop iterating from 1 to 20.
2. Use `continue` to skip printing the even numbers.
```

## Exercise 10: Infinite Loop with User Break
```
Rating: 2/3 (Red)
Task:
1. Create an infinite `loop`.
2. Break the loop if a specific condition is met. (e.g., a variable reaches a certain value)
```

## Exercise 11: Loop Through a Vector
```
Rating: 1/3 (Yellow)
Task:
1. Create a vector of integers.
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the vector and print each element.
```

## Exercise 12: Countdown with While Loop
```
Rating: 1/3 (Yellow)
Task:
1. Use a `while` loop to create a countdown from 10 to 1.
2. Print each number.
```

## Exercise 13: Nested Loop to Print a Pattern
```
Rating: 2/3 (Red)
Task:
1. Use nested loops to print a simple pattern (e.g., a triangle or a square).
```

## Exercise 14: Looping Through a Multidimensional Array
```
Rating: 3/3 (Purple)
Task:
1. Create a 3x3 multidimensional array.
2. Use nested loops to print each element of the array.
```

## Exercise 15: Factorial with a For Loop
```
Rating: 1/3 (Yellow)
Task:
1. Use a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of a given number (e.g., 5).
2. Print the factorial result.
Hint:
The factorial of a number (n!) is the product of all natural numbers up to (and including) n.
For example, 10! = 10*9*8*7*...*3*2*1=3628800
```

## Bonus Challenge: Prime Numbers
```
Rating: 4/3 (Extra difficult)
Task:
1. Write a program that uses nested loops to find and print the first 10 prime numbers.
2. Optimize the program to reduce the number of iterations.

Hint:
a. Remember, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
b. You might start with a simple approach and then think about how to make the loop more efficient.
c. Consider ways to check if a number is prime without having to divide by every number smaller than it.
