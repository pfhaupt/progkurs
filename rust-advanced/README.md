# RUSTikales Rust for advanced coders
## Overview
This subdirectory contains resources for my Rust course aimed towards advanced programmers.  
Each session is made out of those parts:
- original.pptx - Original PowerPoint presentation
- slides.pdf - Presentation exported as PDF
- Optionally: Some example projects to showcase something
  - For example, a small project to showcase macros
## Usage
`git clone` to get a local copy of this repository. Then regularly `git pull` to get the updated slides.  
Alternatively, you can browse it on Github, which also supports PDF and Markdown rendering.
